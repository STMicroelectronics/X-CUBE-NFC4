## <b>EH Example Description</b>

This example application shows how to enable the energy harvesting.

Example Description:
  
Press the user button to enable the EH dynamic register and allow energy
harvesting until the chip is reset
- The EH dynamic is enabled and allows energy harvesting until the chip is reset.
- The blue LED is switched ON when the dynamic register is enabled

Press the user button for more than 2 seconds.
- The EH static register is enabled and allows energy harvesting by default each
  time the chip is powered.
- The green LED is switched ON when the static register is enabled


X-NUCLEO-NFC04A1 dynamic NFC/RFID tag IC expansion board is based on the ST25DV04K
NFC Type V/RFID tag IC with a dual interface 4 Kbits EEPROM that also features an IÂ²C interface. It
can be powered by the pin of Arduino connector or directly by the received carrier electromagnetic field

The ST25DV04K features a low power down (LPD) pin, a general purpose output (GPO)
and an energy harvesting feature that lets you output the energy coming from the RF field
on the Vout analog pin and acts on ST1 jumper to enable it

Known limitations:

- When starting the project from Example Selector in STM32CubeMX and regenerating it
  from ioc file, you may face a build issue. To solve it, if you started the project for the
  Nucleo-F401RE board, remove from the IDE project the file stm32f4xx_nucleo.c in the Application/User
  virtual folder and delete, from Src and Inc folders, the files: stm32f4xx_nucleo.c, stm32f4xx_nucleo.h
  and stm32f4xx_nucleo_errno.h.
  The same operations apply if you starts the project for another STM32 Nucleo board (e.g. for
  Nucleo-L053R8, the files to be removed are stm32l0xx_nucleo.c, stm32l0xx_nucleo.c, stm32l0xx_nucleo.h
  and stm32l0xx_nucleo_errno.h).

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo boards with X-NUCLEO-NFC04A1 STM32 expansion board
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-F401RE RevC board  
    - NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC board
    - NUCLEO-L476RG RevC board
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.

### <b>How to use it?</b> 

-   In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
    - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors after building.
    - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.10.1). Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with V5.37.0) or the IAR toolchain   (this firmware has been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V9.20.1).
    - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
    - Run the example.
    - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" folder included in the distributed package.
