@par Description of M4 Cube example with Linux Remote Processor Framework

When Cube firmware is running on Cortex-M4, System Clock tree and regulators(vrefbuf) are configured by Cortex-A7
Besides, clock source for each peripheral assigned to Cortex-M4 is done by Cortex-A7.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work with Linux running on Cortex-A7, you must do the following :
Before running M4 Cube example, you have to
1) interrupt uboot
2) choose the stm32mp157c-ev1-m4-examples-sdcard configuration to make sure that M4 resources are assigned to Linux Resource Manager driver

Then,
 - Start example using the following command: "fw_cortex_m4.sh start" under example directory installed in userfs partition
     * it will load and start firmware using Linux Remote Processor
 - Stop example using the following command: "fw_cortex_m4.sh stop" under example directory installed in userfs partition
     * it will stop firmware using Linux Remote Processor

@par Example Description
How to use Mailbox.

This project runs with CPU2 (Cortex-M4) firmware.
Mailbox uses the following HW resources
    * I2C5
    * GPIOA PIN11, PIN12
    * GPIOD PIN1, PIN15
    * GPIOE PIN1, PIN10, PIN13
    * MCUSRAM peripheral for buffer communications (virtio buffers) between CPU1(CA7) and CPU2(CM4)
            Reserved shared memeory region for this example: SHM_ADDR=0x10040000 and SHM_SIZE=128k.
            It is defined in platform_info.c file

In this example:
    - Remote Core (CM4) initializes I2C5 and PIOs.
    - Remote Core (CM4) initializes the ST25DV-I2C, blinking the LEDs.
    - Remote Core (CM4) enables the Mailbox.
    - Remote Core (CM4) writes the ST25DV-I2C Mailbox and read back written values.
    - Remote Core (CM4) disables the Mailbox.
    - Remote Core (CM4) checks Mailbox values are 0xFF.

    Notes:
    - It requires Linux console to run example.
    - CM4 logging is redirected in Shared memory in MCUSRAM and can be displayed in Linux console for verdict
      using following command:
          cat /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/trace0

    Following command should be done in Linux console on CA7 to run the example :

    > ./fw_cortex_m4.sh start
    > ./fw_cortex_m4.sh stop


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32MP157CACx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32MP157C-DK2 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
