@par Example Description 

This example application shows how to write an NDEF message to the ST25DV EEPROM using the
NDEF lib middleware.
------------------------------------
WARNING: When starting the project from Example Selector in STM32CubeMX and regenerating it
from ioc file, you may face a build issue. To solve it, if you started the project for the
Nucleo-L476RG board, remove from the IDE project the file stm32l4xx_nucleo.c in the Application/User
virtual folder and delete, from Src and Inc folders, the files: stm32l4xx_nucleo.c, stm32l4xx_nucleo.h
and stm32l4xx_nucleo_errno.h.
The same operations apply if you starts the project for another STM32 Nucleo board (e.g. for
Nucleo-L053R8, the files to be removed are stm32l0xx_nucleo.c, stm32l0xx_nucleo.c, stm32l0xx_nucleo.h
and stm32l0xx_nucleo_errno.h).
------------------------------------
The yellow LED is switched ON when the message has been successfully written.

The tag URI message can be read using an Android smartphone and the ST25
NFC app available on Google Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.st25nfc&hl=en_SG. 

X-NUCLEO-NFC04A1 dynamic NFC/RFID tag IC expansion board is based on the ST25DV04K
NFC Type V/RFID tag IC with a dual interface 4 Kbits EEPROM that also features an I²C interface. It
can be powered by the pin of Arduino connector or directly by the received carrier electromagnetic field

The ST25DV04K features a low power down (LPD) pin, a general purpose output (GPO)
and an energy harvesting feature that lets you output the energy coming from the RF field
on the Vout analog pin and acts on ST1 jumper to enable it


NO SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU BY STMICROELECTRONICS FOR ANY OF THE

@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.6.1).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.32.0) or the IAR toolchain (this firmware has 
   been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V8.50.9).
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.
