@par Example Description 

X-NUCLEO-NFC_software.exe can drive the ST25DV through the ST-LINK USB.

When the STM32 Nucleo board is connected, the communication user interface detects the
X-NUCLEO-NFC04A1 expansion board.

1. Open the user interface for the X-NUCLEO-NFC04A1 by clicking on the related button.
2. Access ST25DV registers and memory area by selecting the various tabs
	- EEPROM Tab : to access the ST25DV EEPROM content
	- FTM tab refers to the fast transfer mode
	- Dynamic registers tab refers to volatile registers
	- Configuration tab refers to static registers
	- Registers & RF infos tab refers to read-only registers
	- Password management tab refers to the IÂ²C session feature
	- The remaining tabs are dedicated to NDEF type 5
